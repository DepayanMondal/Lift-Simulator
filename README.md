# Lift Simulator

## Overview

The Lift Simulator is a dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the operation of lifts in a building, allowing users to input the number of floors and lifts, request lifts, and observe their movements.

## Features

- **Lift Request:** Users can request lifts by clicking on up or down buttons displayed on each floor.
- **Lift Allocation:** The simulator intelligently allocates available lifts based on user requests and current lift positions.
- **Lift Movement Animation:** Lift movements between floors are animated using CSS transitions.
- **Status Updates:** Users are provided with real-time updates on lift movements and status.
- **Queue Management:** If all lifts are busy, requests are queued and processed as lifts become available.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS:** Used for structuring the interface and styling components.
